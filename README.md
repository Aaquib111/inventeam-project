# Inventing a way to help with social distancing for students with ASD and personal space intrusion issues.
Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam project for the year 2020. 

The project consists of an arduino uno hooked up with an IR sensor, an ultrasonic rangefinder, and a vibration motor. These sensors are neatly packaged in an easy to use 3D printed container. Using these sensors, the user can recieve real time feedback when they get too close to another person. The threshold for distance will be adjustable through an app designed to be used by the caretaker of the student.

This project is also useful during the Covid-19 pandemic, where social distancing is paramount to prevent getting and spreading the virus.
